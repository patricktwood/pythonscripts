In order to run this script a few python libraries are needed:
	Tkinter or tkinter (Depends on the version of python you are runnning)
	time
	random

The Script needs to be in the same folder as the BlobClass.py script.

This is a simple Blob Simulation that can create and freeze randomly colored blobs.

There are a few buttons that can be used to operate the simulation:
	Add Blob adds a randomly colored blob with random coordinates, speed and direction.
	Freeze Blob freezes the last blob that was entered into the simulation.
	About rotates through the about information of the simulatuion.
	Quit closes the simulation.

I added a clock so you won't lose track of time!

I hope you enjoy!
